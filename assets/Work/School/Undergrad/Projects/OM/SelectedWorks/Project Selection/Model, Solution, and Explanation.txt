Project Selection Problem:

For the project selection problem, there exists:

	- Set of jobs
	- Set of equipment
	- The revenue produced if a job is accepted (R)
	- A limit to hours worked
	- A binary variable representing the need for equipment
	- A cost for renting equipment (C)

There are two binary variables:

	X = accept job j or not
	Y = rent equipment e or not

We want to maximize profit:

	max âˆ‘ (R * X) - (C *Y)

This is subject to a constraint on total hours worked and if the equipment necessary to do the job is rented.

When the code is run, the following output is returned:

CPLEX 12.10.0.0: optimal integer solution; objective 388
9 MIP simplex iterations
0 branch-and-bound nodes
x[j] [*] :=
J1  1
J4  1
;

y[e] [*] :=
A  1
B  1
D  1
;

Meaning that jobs J! and J4 should be taken by renting equipment A, B, and D in order to maximize profit.
