ELECTRICITY PROBLEM:

**Electricity measured by MWhr**

For the Electricity problem, there exists:

	- A demand forecast for daily electricity required over the course of a week
	- Set of days in the week
	- A cost for using your own power plant (A)
	- A cost for using a rented power plant (B)
	- A cost for purchasing power (C)
	- A cost for storing power (S)
	- A daily limit to energy from each source of electricity

For each cost, there respectively exists a decision variable representing how much energy
is taken that day from that source {W, X, Y, Z}

We want to minimize the costs of providing electricity while efficiently
fulfilling the demand forecast:


		min âˆ‘ (A * W) + (B * X) + (C * Y) + (S * Z)
		
This is subject to:

		W <= 500  (daily)
		X <= 600  (daily)
		Y <= 500  (daily)
		Z[0] = 0
		Z[6] = 0
		Z[i-1] + W[i] + X[i] + Y[i] = demand[i] + Z[i]


When the code is run, the following output is returned for the most efficient production plan:

W[i] [*] :=     (ENERGY FROM OWN PLANT BY DAY)
1  500
2  500
3  500
4  500
5  500
6  500
7  500
;

X[i] [*] :=     (ENERGY FROM RENTED PLANT BY DAY)
1  600
2  600
3  345
4  600
5  600
6  600
7  600
;

Y[i] [*] :=     (ENERGY PURCHASED BY DAY)
1  130
2   90
6  175
7  410
;

Z[i] [*] :=     (ENERGY STORED BY DAY)
4  165
5  350
;

***EXTRA CREDIT***

To modify the model to adjust for a 10% loss on energy stored from the previous day,
a new constraint can be added:

	subject to ConservationOfEnergy{i in END}: Z[i] = Z[i-1] * 0.9
	
This will represent only being able to use 90% of what was stored the previous day.
