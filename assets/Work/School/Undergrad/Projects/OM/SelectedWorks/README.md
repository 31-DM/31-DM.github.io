## Selected Works â€“ Optimization Modeling

This subfolder contains individual optimization projects completed during the course. Each folder documents a distinct modeling problem, including a real-world scenario, mathematical formulation, AMPL code, and solution output

### Projects

- [**Library Location**](./Library%20Location)  
  Cost-minimizing facility location across five townships using a binary integer programming model

- [**Olive Oil Mixing**](./Olive%20Oil%20Mixing)  
  Profit-maximizing blending problem constrained by labeling rules for regional olive oil branding

- [**Project Selection**](./Project%20Selection)  
  Resource-constrained optimization problem determining which jobs to accept based on equipment rental costs and budget

Each folder includes:
- A visual and PDF version of the original problem prompt
- `.mod` and `.dat` files written in AMPL
- A project-specific `README.md` with problem summary, model overview, and solution analysis
- Output files with solver results and interpretation

*Additional projects will be added as they are documented*
