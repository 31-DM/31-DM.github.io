LAW PROBLEM:

For the law problem, there exists:

	- 5 separate cases that may be solved (P)
	- 5 separate associates (Q)
	- A requirement for one-to-one assignment of cases to associates/associates to cases
	
Each associate has a certain % chance to win or lose the case, with the % chance to win the case being:

	% chance to win the case = 100% - % chance to lose the case,
	
			*represented by w[Q, P]*	

A binary decision variable "l" determines which case will be assigned to which associate.

We want to maximize the % chance of winning all of the cases, as each case has equal payout for winning
and no payout for losing:

	max âˆ‘ w[Q, P] * l[Q, P]
	
This is subject to a one-to-one assignment of cases/associates to associates/cases.

When the code is run, the following output is received:

CPLEX 12.10.0.0: optimal integer solution; objective 404.78
set {q in ASSOCIATE, p in CASE: l[q,p] > 0}  :=
(Julie,C1)      (John,C5)       (Jim,C3)        (Jonathan,C2)   (Jack,C4);

When interpreted:

Case One - Julie
Case Two - Jonathan
Case Three- Jim
Case Four - Jack
Case Five - John

This solution represents the assignment that will result in the highest percent chance of winning
all of the cases, which is:

	404.78/500 = 0.80956 = 80.956% chance of winning all of the cases
