Olive Oil Mixing Problem:

For the oil mixing problem there exists:

	- Set of oil sources
	- Set of mixed oils
	- Available amounts of oil from sources
	- Selling price of oils (P)
	- Percentages of oil from sources needed to be blended in order to make mixed oils

The variables are:

	x = amount of type i oil used to make oil j
	y = amount of oils produced
	z = amount of oils used in process

We want to maximize profit:

	max âˆ‘ P * Y

This is subject to availability of source oils, conservation of source oils, and the percentage limits defined necessary to create the mixed oils.

When the code is run, the following output is returned:

CPLEX 12.10.0.0: optimal solution; objective 1223400

x[i,j] :=

y[j] [*] :=

SP   653.333
;

z[i] [*] :=

;

Meaning to maximize profit, the above amounts of source oils should be used to create the above amounts of mixed oils.
