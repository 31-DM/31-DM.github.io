Library Location Problem:

For the library location problem, there exists:

	- Set of towns (T)
	- Cost of building libraries (Cost)
	- Location of town
	- Population of town
	- Capacity of library built

There are three variables:

	x = whether to build a library or not (binary)
	y = whether the library can service another district or not (binary)
	z = population service variable

We want to minimize the cost:

	min âˆ‘ {t in T} x[t]*Cost[t]

This is subject to capacity constraints, closest location constraints, and population constraints.

When the code is run, the following output is received:

CPLEX 12.10.0.0: optimal integer solution; objective 30.24
13 MIP simplex iterations
0 branch-and-bound nodes
x[t] [*] :=
Goldbridge  1
 Silverton  1
;

y[t,u] :=
Goldbridge Brasskill     1
Goldbridge Goldbridge    1
Goldbridge Ironhill      1
Goldbridge Pewterplace   1
Silverton  Silverton     1
;

Meaning a library should be built in Goldbridge and Silverton.
