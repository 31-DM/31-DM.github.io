BBQ PROBLEM:

For the BBQ problem, there exists:

	- 4 plants with a certain stock (W)
	- 8 order locations with a certain demand (S)
	
To send a certain amount of stock w to a location, there exists a shipping cost,
represented by c[Q,P], q∈ W, p∈ S

The amount sent to an order location from a plant is represented by the decision variable "x"

We want to minimize the delivery cost and find an optimal delivery plan to efficiently
fulfill the demand requirements:

		min ∑ c[Q,P] * x[Q,P]
		
This is subject to the demand constraint of satisfying demand exactly along with the 
supply constraint of not exceeding the stock levels. 

When the code is run, the following output is returned for the most optimal delivery path:

x[q,p] :=
