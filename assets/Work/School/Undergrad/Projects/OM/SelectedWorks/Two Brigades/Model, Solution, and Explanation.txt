For the updated version of the two brigades problem, the variables, constraints, and objective functions remain exactly the same. 
Because of the addition of a new home base, the set of nodes and arcs along with various parameters must be updated. 
The resulting model is shown below:

SETS - 

	Nodes N - Node "s" removed and replaced with nodes "s1" and "s2"

	Arcs A ⊆ N × N - Updated to include newly created arcs 

	Brigades B.


PARAMETERS - 

	Supply: s[b, n], b ∈ B, ninN – number of soldiers from brigade b ∈ B residing at node n ∈ N.
		**updated with new nodes s1 and s2**

	Demand: d[b, n], b ∈ B, ninN – number of soldiers from brigade b ∈ B supposed to arrive to node n ∈ N.
		**updated with new nodes s1 and s2**

	Capacities of arcs u[i, j], (i, j) ∈ A
		**updated with new nodes s1 and s2**

	Unit cost of travel along arcs: c[i, j], (i, j) ∈ A.
		**updated with new nodes s1 and s2**

	Unit penalty costs of not traveling: p[b, b] ∈ B.
	

VARIABLES -

	x[b, i, j],  – number of members of brigade b traveling along arc (i, j) (from i to j.)
	   >= 0 for allb ∈ B, (i, j) ∈ A (integral)

	y[b, j],  – number of members of brigade b ∈ B not departing from node j ∈ N (modifying supply).
	   >= 0 for all b ∈ B, j ∈ N (integral)

	z[b, j],  – number of members of brigade b ∈ B not arriving to node j ∈ N (modifying demand).
	   >= 0 for allb ∈ B, j ∈ N (integral)


CONSTRAINTS - 

	Capacity constraints along arcs:

		 Σ x[b, i, j] ≤ u[i, j] for all arcs (i, j) ∈ A.
		b ∈ B

	Law of conservation of material:
		
		s[b, j] − y[b, j] + Σ x[b, i, j] = d[b, j] − z[b, j] + Σ x[b, j, k] for all j ∈ N and b ∈ B.
			      (i, j) ∈ A  		 (j, k) ∈ A

	Departure limitations:

		y[b, j] ≤ s[b, j] for all b ∈ B and j ∈ N.

	Arrival limitations:

		z[b, j] ≤ d[b, j] for all b ∈ B and j ∈ N.


OBJECTIVE FUNCTION - 

	min  Σ c[i, j]  *  Σ x[b, i, j]  +  Σ p[b]  *  Σ z[b, j]
	     (i, j) ∈ A      b ∈ B	           b ∈ B         j ∈ N
