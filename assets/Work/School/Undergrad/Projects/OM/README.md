## Optimization Modeling (OM)

### Overview  
This folder showcases selected problem-solving work from the **Optimization Modeling** course, where I formulated real-world decision problems as mathematical optimization models, encoded them in **AMPL**, and solved them using industry-standard solver packages including **CPLEX** and **XPressMP**

**Course Grade:** A  

### Contents  
- [SelectedWorks](./SelectedWorks): Collection of optimization modeling projects across multiple domains

Example projects:
- **Library Location** – Determine optimal facility placement under cost and capacity constraints
- **Olive Oil Mixing** – Maximize profit while meeting labeling requirements for blended olive oil
- **Project Selection** – Select jobs and rent equipment within budget to optimize total return

## Business & Practical Impact

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: These models reflect real-world business challenges where analytical rigor drives operational and financial decisions  
- **Optimization in Practice**: Projects like facility placement, resource allocation, and product blending mirror problems faced in **supply chain**, **manufacturing**, **retail**, and **tech strategy**  
- **Scalable Skillset**: Techniques demonstrated here are foundational to roles in **operations research**, **data science**, **financial modeling**, and **logistics planning**

## Why This Project Matters

Optimization isn’t just math — it’s a way to **formalize and solve real-world decisions** under constraints  
The work in this repository demonstrates my ability to:
- Translate business scenarios into structured models
- Make decisions under limited resources
- Extract actionable insights from abstract math
- Use **AMPL**, a professional-grade modeling tool, to drive results

## What Is AMPL?

**AMPL** (A Mathematical Programming Language) is a domain-specific language for describing and solving optimization problems

In each subproject folder, you’ll find:
- A `.mod` file defining the **model structure** (variables, objective, constraints)
- A `.dat` file providing the **problem-specific data**
- A solution explanation and output from a solver like **CPLEX**

### How to Run AMPL Models

You can run these models without installing anything using **AMPLT**, the official free online solver:

1. Visit [ampl.com/try-ampl](https://ampl.com/try-ampl)
2. Upload the `.mod` and `.dat` files from any project folder
3. Type `solve` in the command line interface
4. View the output, variable values, and objective result

AMPLT supports industry solvers like **CPLEX**, **Gurobi**, and **HiGHS** in an accessible interface

## Course Objectives  
- Develop a structured understanding of **linear and integer programming**
- Learn to model real-world decision scenarios using **high-level modeling languages like AMPL**
- Apply **professional solvers** to identify optimal or near-optimal solutions
- Gain fluency in interpreting solver output and translating results into action

---

## Problem Types Covered  
- **Facility Location** – Balancing coverage and cost
- **Resource Allocation** – Selecting jobs and tools under budget
- **Blending Problems** – Satisfying product composition rules under supply limits
- **Network/Flow Optimization** – (to be added in future projects)

## Modeling Workflow  
1. Define sets, parameters, and variables  
2. Formulate objective function(s)  
3. Apply constraints based on real-world logic  
4. Encode the model in AMPL  
5. Test and solve using optimization software  
6. Interpret and validate the results

Each subproject includes:
- A PDF and visual snapshot of the original problem
- `.mod` and `.dat` files
- A `README.md` summarizing the logic and results
- Solver output and analysis
