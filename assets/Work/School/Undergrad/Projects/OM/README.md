#### Course Overview (from syllabus):
"We frequently have to make decision in real life so that we achieve our goals. Many times that
involves making choices, sometimes hard, among available alternatives. Almost always we are
limited by some of the resources that we need to achieve our goals, and our decisions are about
the “best” utilization of these resources in order to achieve our goals. Optimization is an area that
offers tools and techniques to formulate models for our decision problems. In this course we are
going to learn some of the basic types of models, a high level modeling language to encode our
models in a computer interpretable way, and the use of professional optimization packages to
solve our models in order to obtain the “best” possible decisions.
The course is self-contained supported by weekly handouts. It is highly interactive, with lots of
homework assignments. We learn together modeling techniques, AMPL encoding, and the use of
the solver packages via a series of examples. AMPL is a high level modeling language that
allows us to formulate even complicated mathematical optimization models in an elegant and
short way. The course utilizes full versions of top of the art solver packages, that are made
available by AMPL Inc., in time limited course packets, which are distributed via the course’s
canvas site.

This course is designed to help students develop skills and knowledge in the following area(s):
Analyze decision problems and available data; build optimization models for certain standard
types of problems, encode these problems in AMPL and solve them by the available solver
package that includes CPLEX, XPressMP, and other state for the art optimization software.
Students who complete this course will demonstrate the following: The ability to analyze real
life decision problems, evaluate the data need for the decision maker, and interpret solutions
provided by optimization software." (taken directly from syllabus)
